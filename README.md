# Object-Retrieval
Particular object retrieval using CNN

Code for the arxiv submission https://128.84.21.199/abs/1703.01226. 

The source code is a modification of the codes available at http://www.xrce.xerox.com/Our-Research/Computer-Vision/Learning-Visual-Representations/Deep-Image-Retrieval. Follow the instructions in the above link to setup the installations. Then replace the file "test.py" with "SA.py", and the same set of commands provided in their README should work fine. However, to reproduce the results in our paper, the command associated with multi-resolution should be used (explained in detail in README from the Xerox-link).
